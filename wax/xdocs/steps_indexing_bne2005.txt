These are the steps run indexing a small collection, the british national
election, 2005.  The collection comprises 206 ARCs of about ~20gigs compressed.

$Id$

Heres how I did the count of ARCs after logging into homeserver:

    bash-2.05$ ~webcrawl/crawl-arc-cfg/db-arc-info -like \
        BRITISH-NATIONAL-ELECTION-2005%  |grep '.arc.gz' | \
        awk '{print $6}' |sort -u |wc

There are 206 of them.

Heres how I obtained a list of all BE arcs and where they are located:

    bash-2.05$ ~webcrawl/crawl-arc-cfg/db-arc-info -like \
        BRITISH-NATIONAL-ELECTION-2005% | awk '{print $2$4}' | \
        sort | grep -e -bu. | uniq

It returned:

    crawldata0025a-bu.archive.org:/0
    crawldata0027a-bu.archive.org:/3
    crawldata0029a-bu.archive.org:/1
    crawldata0029a-bu.archive.org:/2
    crawldata0029a-bu.archive.org:/3
    crawldata0030a-bu.archive.org:/0
    crawldata0031a-bu.archive.org:/0
    crawldata0032a-bu.archive.org:/0

I put above into a file named /tmp/becollection.txt.

I NFS mounted them all by doing this (after becoming su):

    % mkdir /mnt/becollection
    % for i in `cat /tmp/bemachines.txt`; \
        do subpath=`echo $i|sed -n -e 's/://p'`; \
        mntpoint="/mnt/becollection/$subpath"; \
        mkdir -p $mntpoint; \
        mount -t nfs -o ro,rsize=8192,wsize=8192,intr,nfsvers=2 $i $mntpoint; \        done

Next, get nutch software and the archive-access extensions.  Follow
instructions on this page:

    http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/*checkout*/archive-access/\
        archive-access/projects/nutch/README.txt?rev=1

Read requirements and do the ONE-TIME SETUP.

Set configurations in nutch-site.xml.  Make sure right plugins are present.
Do you want the parse-default to catch all but html instead of the html parse?
If so, see notes in the README.txt cited above in the INDEXING NOTES section.

Build in home directory rather than on /3 because above disks are mounted
w/ the nfs option 'noexec' (Bash won't run).

Run below script (206 arcs will take hours).

    % nohup ./bin/indexarcs.sh -n -f \
        "BRITISH-NATIONAL-ELECTION-2005*arc.gz" \
        -s /mnt/becollection/ -d /3/british_election_indexing/nutch-data \
        &> /3/british_election_indexing/indexing`date +%FT%H:%M`.log \
        < /dev/null &
